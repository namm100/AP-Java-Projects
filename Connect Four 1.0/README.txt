Connect Four v2 1.0
This version works but you have to be very gentle with it.
Click on the Connect Four v2.jar file, double tap it and it will open up the app.
But, you need to have the two image files, playerOnePiece.png and playerTwoPiece.png
with it in the same directory for it to load the images.
